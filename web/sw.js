/*
 * The service worker, which exists for two reasons.
 *
 * 1. Chrome will not offer "Install app" without one that handles fetch. No
 *    service worker means Add to Home Screen gives you a bookmark with a
 *    browser bar, not an app.
 * 2. Opening an installed app to a blank page because the server was briefly
 *    unreachable is a bad first impression. The shell is cached, so the app
 *    frame appears instantly and the data loads behind it.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT do is cache API responses. Every screen here
 * is about what is happening right now - a queue, a job's progress, what has
 * been cleaned. A stale queue served from cache would be worse than an error,
 * because it looks correct.
